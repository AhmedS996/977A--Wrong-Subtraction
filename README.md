# 977A--Wrong-Subtraction
explain the code

the answer is come when you know how to find what is the last digit 

let me give it you with example 

if number is "763" so how we will know what is the last digit?

double a = 763  -- int b = 763

a/=10;    -- b/=10;
a= 76.3;  -- b = 76;
answer = a-b;
answer = 0.3;
answer *=10;
answer = 3;

so here we know what is the last digi so we can now do it with if statment to solve the problem.
